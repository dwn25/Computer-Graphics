Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm<br />
Program was written and compiled in java using IntelliJ on MacOS X 10.14. 
In order to run the program, the user must first type and run "javac A3.java" from wherever the program will be run
This creates a class that allows it to be executable from command line.
The program can be run by executing the command "java A3 -f "Postcript file"" Example; "java A3 -f hw3_1.ps"
Must ensuring that the input file is within the same enclosing file as the program.
Should iterate 500 times through an array of size 500*500 for 500 values on each iteration with a """ before and after a row.
The XPM file formatting should be correct but possible some redundant line. Most likely not an issue
Commented out code were for testing
