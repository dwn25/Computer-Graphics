Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm for 3d Transformations Implementation<br />
A bash file has been added that creates the java class and runs the tests that were provided within the pdf. It can be run the same way
as the bash file for the previous assignment; "./runtests.sh"
Program was written and compiled in java using IntelliJ on MacOS X 10.14.1. A class has been added to the java file in order to
streamline testing. Please type "javac A6.java" to create the class file if the class file does not function as it should. Running the
program from command line requires the commands to be entered in the form of "java A6 -f bound-cow.smf -j 0 -k 30 -o 275 -p 305 -P". The
tester must ensure that the input file is saved within the same enclosing folder. The output file will depend on the commands that were
entered. The output file for the above comman will therefore be in the form of "bound-cow_j_0_k_30.0_o_275.0_p_305.0_P.xpm". The commented
out code were used for testing. Homogenous coordinates were implemented in conjunction with ArrayLists where the homogenous coordinates
were taken from stored values in array lists and then used to perform the transformation in the order Scale, Rotate and Translate where
applicable and then stored into arrayLists for a a better understanding or convenient transference between functions. The reference list
can be found below.
