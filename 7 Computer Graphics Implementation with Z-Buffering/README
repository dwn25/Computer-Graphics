Computer Graphics Implementation with Z-Buffering<br />

A bash file has been added that creates the java class and runs the program. It can be run with the command; "./runtests.sh"
Program was written and compiled in java using IntelliJ on MacOS X 10.14.1. A class has been added to the java file in order to
streamline testing. Please type "javac A7.java" to create the class file if the class file does not function as it should. Running the
program from command line requires the commands to be entered in the form of "java A7 -f bound-bunny_1k.smf -g bound-cow.smf -i bound-sprtrd.smf". 
The tester must ensure that the input file is saved within the same enclosing folder. The output file will depend on the commands that were
entered. The output file for the above command will therefore be in the form of "bound-bunny_1kbound-cowbound-sprtrd.xpm". The commented
out code were used for testing. Homogenous coordinates were implemented in conjunction with ArrayLists where the homogenous coordinates
were taken from stored values in array lists and then used to perform the transformation in the order Scale, Rotate and Translate where
applicable and then stored into arrayLists for a a better understanding or convenient transference between functions. The reference list
can be found below. Majority of tests run as expected
