Implementation of Scan Fill Algorithm<br />
Program was written and compiled in java using IntelliJ on MacOS X 10.14.1. 
In order to run the program, the user must first type and run "javac A4.java" from wherever the program will be run
This creates a class that allows it to be executable from command line.
The program can be run by executing the command "java A4 -f "Postcript file"" Example; "java A4 -f hw4_1.ps"
Must ensure that the input file is within the same enclosing file as the program.
Commented out code were for testing

Inspiration for the implementation of Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm was gathered from;
